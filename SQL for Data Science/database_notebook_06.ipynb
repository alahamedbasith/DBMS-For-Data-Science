    "# 6. Subqueries and its Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "A Subquery is a query within another SQL query and embedded within the WHERE clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A subquery can be placed in a number of SQL clauses like WHERE clause, FROM clause, HAVING clause.\n",
    "   - You can use Subquery with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with the operators like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc.\n",
    "   - A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is known as the main query, and the inner query is known as a subquery.\n",
    "   - Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.\n",
    "   - A subquery is enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "   - In the Subquery, ORDER BY command cannot be used. But GROUP BY command can be used to perform the same function as ORDER BY command.\n"
