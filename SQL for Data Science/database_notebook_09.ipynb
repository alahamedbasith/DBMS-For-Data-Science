    "# 9. Triggers in RDBMS (MySQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **trigger** is a set of instructions that are automatically executed (or \"triggered\") in response to a specific event on a particular table in a database. These events can be `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trigger Timing**: Determines when the trigger's action should be executed in relation to the triggering event. The two options are:\n",
    "   - `BEFORE`: The trigger is executed before the event.\n",
    "   - `AFTER`: The trigger is executed after the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trigger Event**: The type of SQL operation that activates the trigger. The three options are:\n",
    "   - `INSERT`\n",
    "   - `UPDATE`\n",
    "   - `DELETE`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trigger Body**: The SQL statements that are executed when the trigger is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **OLD and NEW Keywords**: These are used to refer to the values of the affected rows.\n",
    "   - `OLD`: Refers to the row values before the triggering event.\n",
    "   - `NEW`: Refers to the row values after the triggering event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple example to illustrate how to use triggers in MySQL. We'll use two tables: `employees` and `audit_log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **employees**: Stores information about employees.\n",
    "- **audit_log**: Keeps a log of changes made to the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    position VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE audit_log (\n",
    "    log_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    employee_id INT,\n",
    "    action VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    action_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n",
    "    old_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    new_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the Trigger**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following trigger will log any changes to an employee's salary in the `audit_log` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER //\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update\n",
    "BEFORE UPDATE ON employees\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    IF NEW.salary != OLD.salary THEN\n",
    "        INSERT INTO audit_log (employee_id, action, old_salary, new_salary)\n",
    "        VALUES (OLD.employee_id, 'Salary Update', OLD.salary, NEW.salary);\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "\n",
    "//\n",
    "\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The trigger is named `before_employee_update`.\n",
    "- It is a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger, meaning it will activate before an `UPDATE` operation on the `employees` table.\n",
    "- The trigger checks if the `salary` field is being changed (`IF NEW.salary != OLD.salary`).\n",
    "- If the salary is changed, it inserts a record into the `audit_log` table, capturing the employee's ID, action description, old salary, and new salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test the Trigger**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert a sample record into the `employees` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Manager', 60000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the employee's salary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the `audit_log` table to see the log entry:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM audit_log;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a record indicating the salary change for the employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers are powerful tools in RDBMS like MySQL that allow you to automatically execute actions in response to certain events. This example demonstrates how to use triggers to maintain an audit log of changes to an employee's salary. The principles can be applied to other scenarios as needed."

    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "1. **Database Creation**:\n",
    "   - `CREATE DATABASE Triggers;` creates a new database named `Triggers`.\n",
    "   - `USE Triggers;` switches to the `Triggers` database for subsequent operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table Creation**:\n",
    "   - `CREATE TABLE Products(...);` creates the `Products` table with columns for `product_id`, `name`, and `stock`.\n",
    "   - `CREATE TABLE inventory_log(...);` creates the `inventory_log` table with columns for `log_id`, `product_id`, `change_type`, `change_amount`, and `change_time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Insertion**:\n",
    "   - `INSERT INTO Products...;` inserts initial product data into the `Products` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trigger Creation**:\n",
    "   - The `AFTER UPDATE` trigger named `after_stock_update` logs changes in stock to the `inventory_log` table after any update on the `Products` table.\n",
    "   - The `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger named `before_stock_update` logs changes in stock to the `inventory_log` table before any update on the `Products` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Update**:\n",
    "   - `UPDATE Products SET stock = 15 WHERE product_id = 1;` updates the stock of the product with `product_id` 1 (Laptop) to 15.\n",
    "   - `UPDATE Products SET stock = 3 WHERE product_id = 2;` updates the stock of the product with `product_id` 2 (Monitor) to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Selection**:\n",
    "   - `SELECT * FROM Products;` and `SELECT * FROM inventory_log;` retrieve and display all records from the `Products` and `inventory_log` tables respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "- The `DELIMITER //` and `DELIMITER ;` commands are used to change the statement delimiter so that the entire trigger creation statement can be treated as a single statement.\n",
    "- The `DECLARE` and `SET` statements within the triggers are used to calculate the change in stock.\n",
    "- The triggers log the changes in the `inventory_log` table with appropriate `change_type` and `change_amount`."
