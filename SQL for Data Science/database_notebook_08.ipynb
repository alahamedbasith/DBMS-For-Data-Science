    "# 8. SQL Stored Procedures: Full Concept with Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed on the database server. They are used to encapsulate and reuse SQL code, improve performance, and ensure data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creation**: Define a stored procedure using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement.\n",
    "2. **Execution**: Run a stored procedure using the `EXEC` or `CALL` statement.\n",
    "3. **Parameters**: Pass values to the procedure using input (`IN`), output (`OUT`), or input-output (`INOUT`) parameters.\n",
    "4. **Logic**: Include control-of-flow constructs (e.g., `IF`, `WHILE`, `LOOP`) within the procedure.\n",
    "5. **Transactions**: Handle transactions within the procedure using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a basic example to illustrate stored procedures in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup: Creating a Sample Table\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating a table named `Employees`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),\n",
    "    DepartmentID INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inserting Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert some sample data into the `Employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DepartmentID)\n",
    "VALUES\n",
    "(1, 'John', 'Doe', 60000, 101),\n",
    "(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 75000, 102),\n",
    "(3, 'Jim', 'Brown', 50000, 103);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Creating a Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a stored procedure to get the details of an employee by their `EmployeeID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN empID INT)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DepartmentID\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Executing the Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the `GetEmployeeDetails` procedure to retrieve details for an employee with `EmployeeID` 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL GetEmployeeDetails(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Creating a Procedure with Output Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a procedure to calculate the total salary of all employees in a specific department.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetTotalSalaryByDepartment(IN deptID INT, OUT totalSalary DECIMAL(10, 2))\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT SUM(Salary) INTO totalSalary\n",
    "    FROM Employees\n",
    "    WHERE DepartmentID = deptID;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Executing the Procedure with Output Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Declare a variable to hold the output and call the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SET @totalSalary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "\n",
    "CALL GetTotalSalaryByDepartment(101, @totalSalary);\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT @totalSalary AS TotalSalary;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Using Control-of-Flow Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a procedure to give a raise to employees based on their performance rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GiveRaise(IN empID INT, IN rating CHAR(1))\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    IF rating = 'A' THEN\n",
    "        UPDATE Employees\n",
    "        SET Salary = Salary * 1.10\n",
    "        WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "    ELSEIF rating = 'B' THEN\n",
    "        UPDATE Employees\n",
    "        SET Salary = Salary * 1.05\n",
    "        WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "    ELSE\n",
    "        UPDATE Employees\n",
    "        SET Salary = Salary * 1.02\n",
    "        WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Executing the Control-of-Flow Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Give a raise to an employee with `EmployeeID` 2 based on a performance rating of 'A'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL GiveRaise(2, 'A');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Handling Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a procedure to transfer an employee to a new department and ensure all operations are consistent using transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE TransferEmployee(IN empID INT, IN newDeptID INT)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION\n",
    "    BEGIN\n",
    "        ROLLBACK;\n",
    "    END;\n",
    "\n",
    "    START TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "    UPDATE Employees\n",
    "    SET DepartmentID = newDeptID\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "\n",
    "    COMMIT;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Executing the Transaction Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer an employee with `EmployeeID` 3 to a new department `104`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL TransferEmployee(3, 104);\n",
    "```\n"

    "### 11. Error Handling in SQL Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling in SQL stored procedures ensures that your procedures can gracefully handle and respond to errors. Commonly used constructs for error handling include `DECLARE HANDLER` for handling exceptions and `SIGNAL` for raising errors. Here, we'll discuss how to use these constructs in the context of our `Employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup: Creating the Employees Table and Inserting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't created the `Employees` table yet, here's the SQL code to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Error Handling with DECLARE HANDLER\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a stored procedure to update an employee's salary. We'll include error handling to roll back the transaction if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary(\n",
    "    IN empID INT, \n",
    "    IN newSalary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ")\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Error Handling with DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a procedure to increase the salaries of all employees. We'll include error handling to continue processing even if an error occurs for a specific employee.\n",
    "\n",

    "    END LOOP raise_loop;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Raising Custom Errors with SIGNAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a procedure that raises a custom error if an employee's salary is set to a value below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "        SET Salary = newSalary\n",
    "        WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "    END IF;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Using EXIT HANDLER for Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a procedure to transfer an employee to a new department and handle errors by rolling back the transaction and performing cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    ")\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION\n",
    "    BEGIN\n",
    "        ROLLBACK;\n",
    "        -- Additional cleanup actions can be performed here\n",
    "        SELECT 'An error occurred during the transfer. The transaction has been rolled back.' AS ErrorMessage;\n",
    "    END;\n",

    "    START TRANSACTION;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    UPDATE Employees\n",
    "    SET DepartmentID = newDeptID\n",
    "    WHERE EmployeeID = empID;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    COMMIT;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Executing the Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute any of the above procedures to see error handling in action. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL UpdateEmployeeSalary(1, 65000);\n",
    "CALL IncreaseAllSalaries(5);\n",
    "CALL SetEmployeeSalary(2, 25000); -- This will raise a custom error\n",
    "CALL TransferEmployee(3, 104);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling in SQL stored procedures is crucial for robust database operations. By using constructs like `DECLARE HANDLER` and `SIGNAL`, you can ensure that your procedures handle exceptions gracefully and maintain data integrity."
