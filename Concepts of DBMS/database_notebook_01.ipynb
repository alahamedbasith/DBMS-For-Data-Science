    "# 1. Introduction from DBMS to Cloud DBMS\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Importance of DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction and Independence**: DBMS abstracts the physical data to logical data structures and provides data independence. This means changes in data storage structures or strategies do not affect the application programs.\n",
    "- **Efficient Data Access**: DBMS uses a variety of sophisticated techniques to store and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "- **Data Integrity and Security**: DBMS provides integrity constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency, and it also provides security mechanisms to protect the data from unauthorized access.\n",
    "- **Data Administration**: DBMS provides tools for database administration, which includes performance monitoring and tuning.\n",
    "- **Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery**: DBMS allows multiple users to access the database concurrently without compromising the integrity of the data, and it provides mechanisms for recovering the database in case of a crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Database Models\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMSs are categorized based on the data model they support. Here are the major types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Hierarchical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree-like structure where each record has a single parent and possibly many children. It is represented by parent-child relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Network Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The network model allows more complex relationships between entities. Unlike the hierarchical model, a record can have multiple parents. It uses graph structures with nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Relational Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The relational model organizes data into tables (relations), where each table consists of rows and columns. Each row is a record, and each column is an attribute of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Object-oriented Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Each object contains both data and methods that operate on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5 Entity-Relationship Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The ER model uses entities and relationships to represent data. Entities are objects that exist independently, and relationships represent the associations between these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Components of DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "A DBMS consists of several key components that work together to manage data effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical devices like computers, storage devices, and network devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Software\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the DBMS software itself, operating system, network software, and application programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual data stored in the database. This includes user data, metadata, and indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.4 Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions and rules that govern the design and use of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.5 Database Access Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The language used to access and manipulate the database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most common database access language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.6 Users\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of users who interact with the DBMS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Administrators (DBA)**: They are responsible for managing the entire database system.\n",
    "- **Database Designers**: They design the database structure.\n",
    "- **End Users**: They are the people who query and update the data.\n",
    "- **Application Programmers**: They develop applications that interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Database Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMS architecture can be categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1 One-tier Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is directly available to the user. Any changes in the database are done directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 Two-tier Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture involves a client and a server. The application at the client end communicates with the database at the server end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3 Three-tier Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this architecture, an additional layer (often called an application server) is added between the client and the server to manage business logic and database access.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DBMS-3-tier-Architecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Database Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "A schema is a blueprint or architecture of a database. It defines how data is organized and how relationships among data are associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 Physical Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Describes how data is stored in the database, including data types, indexes, and storage details. (More Abstract level)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Describes the logical constraints of the data, such as table structures, views, and integrity constraints. (Like Tabular structure of some abstract))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.3 View Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Describes how users interact with the data, including user interfaces and permissions.(Tabular UI)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://afteracademy.com/images/what-is-a-schema-three-levels-of-schema-84a896db453efdac.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1 Normal Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that the values in each column of a table are atomic.\n",
    "- **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Ensures that all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.\n",
    "- **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Ensures that there are no transitive dependencies.\n",
    "- **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Database Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are attributes or a set of attributes that help in identifying a row (or record) in a table uniquely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.1 Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a field (or combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.2 Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a field (or combination of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.3 Candidate Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate key is a field (or combination of fields) that can uniquely identify each record in a table. Each table can have multiple candidate keys, out of which one is selected as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.4 Composite Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple fields to uniquely identify a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.5 Super Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A super key is a set of one or more columns (attributes) that uniquely identify a row in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Transactions in DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1 ACID Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions have the following ACID properties to ensure database reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed.\n",
    "- **Durability**: Ensures that the results of a transaction are permanently recorded in the database even if there is a system failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2 Concurrency Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistencies. Methods include locking, timestamp ordering, and multi-version concurrency control.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.3 Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, causing them to be stuck indefinitely. Techniques to handle deadlocks include timeout, deadlock detection, and deadlock prevention.\n",
    "\n",
