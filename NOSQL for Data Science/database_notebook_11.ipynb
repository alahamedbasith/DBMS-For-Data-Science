    "# 11. SQL and NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Difference between SQL and NoSQL\n",
    "MongoDB and SQL (Structured Query Language) databases represent two distinct paradigms in database management systems: NoSQL and relational databases, respectively. Here's an explanation of MongoDB and its key differences from SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type:** NoSQL Database (Document-Oriented)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:** \n",
    "- MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "- Data is organized into collections, which are analogous to tables in SQL databases, but collections can contain documents with different structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema: Not stricted schema**\n",
    "- Schema-less or dynamic schema: Each document can have a different structure, meaning fields can vary from document to document.\n",
    "- This flexibility allows for easier evolution of data models and the ability to handle semi-structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Model:**\n",
    "- Documents: Individual records stored in collections. Each document is a key-value pair, similar to JSON objects.\n",
    "- Collections: Groups of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queries:**\n",
    "- MongoDB uses a rich query language for operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), aggregation, and indexing.\n",
    "- Queries are written in a JSON-like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:**\n",
    "- MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "- Sharding (partitioning data across many servers) is a built-in feature.\n",
    "- It is also suitable and supports for hadoop big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type:** Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "- Data is stored in tables, with rows representing records and columns representing fields.\n",
    "- Each table must have a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema:stricted schema**\n",
    "- Fixed schema: The structure of the tables (columns, data types, constraints) must be defined before data is inserted.\n",
    "- This rigidity ensures data integrity and consistency but can make schema evolution more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Model:**\n",
    "- Tables: Store rows of data, each row representing a record.\n",
    "- Rows: Individual records in a table.\n",
    "- Columns: Fields within a table, with predefined data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queries:**\n",
    "- SQL databases use SQL for defining and manipulating data. SQL is a standardized language with a rich set of operations.\n",
    "- Queries include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability:**\n",
    "- Traditionally, SQL databases are vertically scalable (adding more power to a single server).\n",
    "- Horizontal scaling is possible but typically more complex than with NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Model:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Document-based, schema-less.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Table-based, fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Flexible schema, allowing for varying structures within a collection.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Fixed schema, requiring predefined table structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Language:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Uses a JSON-like query language.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Uses SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Designed for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Traditionally vertically scalable, with horizontal scaling being more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Integrity and Transactions:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Provides support for multi-document transactions but with some limitations compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Strong support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - **MongoDB:** Suitable for applications with evolving or flexible data models, real-time analytics, and high-scale applications.\n",
    "   - **SQL Databases:** Ideal for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers a flexible, scalable, and schema-less approach to data storage, making it suitable for modern applications with varying data needs. SQL databases provide a structured, reliable, and consistent way to manage data, ideal for applications with well-defined schemas and transactional requirements. The choice between MongoDB and an SQL database depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the application being developed."

    "## 2. Installation Steps of MangoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "To install MongoDB and MongoDB Shell (mongosh), you need to follow different steps depending on your operating system. Here are the installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download MongoDB:**\n",
    "   - Visit the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the Windows installer (MSI).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer:**\n",
    "   - Double-click the downloaded MSI file.\n",
    "   - Follow the installation prompts. Choose \"Complete\" setup.\n",
    "   - Make sure to select the option to \"Install MongoDB as a Service\" if you want MongoDB to start automatically with your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set up Environment Variables:**\n",
    "   - Add MongoDB's `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` variable.\n",
    "   - Typically, this directory is `C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\<version>\\bin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Installation:**\n",
    "   - Open Command Prompt and type `mongod --version` to verify the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Download and Install MongoDB Shell (mongosh):**\n",
    "   - Visit the [MongoDB Shell Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) and download the Windows installer (MSI).\n",
    "   - Run the installer and follow the prompts.\n",
    "   - Add `mongosh` to your system's `PATH` variable if it's not automatically added.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Run MongoDB Shell:**\n",
    "   - Open Command Prompt and type `mongosh` to start the MongoDB shell.\n"
